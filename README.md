# Knowledge Graph Hub (KG-Hub) Support
This is the main forum for KG-Hub issues, support, and discussion. It covers tools, infrastructure, and graph projects.

See the KG-Hub site at https://knowledge-graph-hub.github.io/ for further details.

## I want to start a KG-Hub project!
Our [project template](https://github.com/Knowledge-Graph-Hub/kg-dtm-template) is a great place to start.

You will find a [basic tutorial](https://github.com/Knowledge-Graph-Hub/kg-dtm-template/blob/master/Tutorials/Getting%20Started.ipynb) notebook there, and once you're familiar with the basics, try the [graph machine learning](https://github.com/Knowledge-Graph-Hub/kg-dtm-template/blob/master/Tutorials/Machine%20Learning%20on%20Knowledge%20Graphs.ipynb) tutorial.

## I want to access KG-Hub graphs!
You may see the [active KG-Hub projects here](https://knowledge-graph-hub.github.io/) or [browse all KG-Hub graphs here.](https://kg-hub.berkeleybop.io/)
Most projects include multiple builds, named for the date of their creation (e.g., [20220228](https://kg-hub.berkeleybop.io/kg-covid-19/20220228/index.html)).
Most projects also contain their source data in raw KGX TSV format: see a project's `raw` and `transformed` directories, respectively.

## I want a list of every graph on KG-Hub!
[We provide a frequently-updated MANIFEST here.](https://kg-hub.berkeleybop.io/MANIFEST.yaml)

## I have a bug report or feature request for KG-Hub!
[Please open an issue in this repository.](https://github.com/Knowledge-Graph-Hub/knowledge-graph-hub-support/issues)

This includes requests to add new graphs.

## I have a bug report or feature request about a specific KG-Hub project!
Repositories for KG-Hub projects may be found in the [Knowledge-Graph-Hub organization](https://github.com/Knowledge-Graph-Hub). Please open an issue in the project's repository.
